    <h2>Australian Communication Theory Workshop 2026</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to AusCTW2026.
    </p>

    <p>
            We are proud to be bringing AusCTW to Christchurch in 2026, 
            hosted by the New Zealand Communication theory community.  This will the 
            23rd edition, the second time in Christchurch, and the third time in New Zealand
    </p>

    </h2>

<h3>
    Propose a keynote or tutorial session!
</h3>
<p>
    If you would like to present a keynote or a tutorial session, or you can think
    of someone who would give a great talk on an emerging or hot topic, please
    talk to us.
</p>

<h3>
    Submit an abstract for a poster presentation
</h3>
<p>
    A good conference at its heart needs great technical content, to stimulate
    engagement between participants.  The nature of AusCTW is to present emerging and
    contemporary topics, including 'work in progress' style work.  Papers 
    <b>not</b>> peer reviewed and published in proceedings.  Students in particular
    are encouraged to submit posters.

    Posters will be organised into poster sessions, and delegates will be 
    encouraged to grab a coffee and discuss your work informally with you over 
    your poster.
</p>

<h3>
    Serve on the committee, help with organisation
</h3>
<p>
    We are a small team at the University of Canterbury, and will require <b>your</b>
    assistance to pull this off!  Please get involved.  If you'd like to assistance
    with one of the committee positions, or otherwise behind the scenes, get in 
    touch.  We'll be most grateful for your assistance
</p>

<h3>
    Sponsorship!
</h3>
<p>
    It also takes money to run a successful conference.  If you can assist with Sponsorship
    (your company, or you have contacts that the organising committee can approach), we'd
    love to hear from you!

    <h3>About this website:</h3>
    <p>
        It is a basic static website based off a template.
        I cloned all the files from this
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mikepierce/conference-website-template">GitHub repo here</a>.
        This template was created from a website 
        <a target="_blank" href="http://math.ucr.edu/~mathconn/">MathConnections 2019</a>,
        in case you want to see an example of this template being used in the wild.
