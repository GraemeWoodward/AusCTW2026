    <h2>Australian Communication Theory Workshop 2026</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to AusCTW2026.
    </p>

    <p>
            We are proud to be bringing AusCTW to Christchurch in 2026, 
            hosted by the New Zealand communication theory community.  This will the 
            23rd edition, the second time in Christchurch, and the third time in New Zealand.

    <h2>The many ways <b>you</b> can participate:</h2>

    <h3>Attend AusCTW 2026</h3>
    <p> 
        <td class="navigation"> <a title="registration" href="registration">Registration</a> is now open!  
    </p>
    <p>
        Watch this website for more information as it becomes available.  In the meantime - book your tickets to 
        join us in Christchurch from Monday 2nd February through Wednesday 4th February, 2026.
    </p>
    
<h3>
    Propose a keynote or tutorial session!
</h3>
<p>
    The programme is starting to take shape, but there are still slots for more keynote/tutorial and technical talks.  
    If you would like to present, or you can think
    of someone who would give a great talk on an emerging or hot topic, please
<a href="mailto:ausctw@gmail.com?subject=[AusCTW2026 give-a-talk] "> talk to us</a>.</p>

<h3>
    Submit an abstract for a poster presentation
</h3>
<p>
    A good conference at its heart needs great technical content, to stimulate
    engagement between participants.  The nature of AusCTW is to present emerging and
    contemporary topics, including 'work in progress'.  Papers are
    not peer reviewed and published in proceedings.  Students in particular
    are encouraged to submit abstracts for poster presentations.
</p>
<p>
    Posters will be organised into poster sessions, and delegates will be 
    encouraged to grab a coffee and discuss your work informally with you over 
    your poster.
</p>
<p>
    Submissions now open:  <td class="navigation"> <a title="CFP" href="CFP">Call for Papers.</a>

</p>

<h3>
    Serve on the committee, help with organisation
</h3>
<p>
    We are a small team at the University of Canterbury, and still require more hands to make this the best event it can be!  
    Please get involved.  If you'd like to assist with one of the committee positions, or otherwise behind the scenes, please
    <a href="mailto:ausctw@gmail.com?subject=[AusCTW2026 volunteer]"> get in touch</a>.  

</p>         
  

<h3>
    $ponsorship!
</h3>
<p>
    It also takes money to run a successful conference.  If you can assist with sponsorship
    (your company, or you have contacts that the organising committee can approach), we'd
    love to hear from you!
